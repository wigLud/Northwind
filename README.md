# Northwind
Northwind is my first serious project and I'm really excited for this! :)

Within Northwind the player will be represented by a ghost. This ghost has the power to take control of the bodies of dead creatures.

If the ghost finds a dead rat while exploring a cave he can become that rat and as he has control of the rat its health points will slowly regenerate.

The ghost might take a walk in the forest and encounter a goblin, the ghost may attack the goblin while he's in possesion of a body and if he manages to do so he can dump his current body and instead take control of the goblin!

When the ghost kills creatures he will become better and better at controlling the type of body he is using, his level increases and he will therefore be stronger in combat.

If the ghost dies in combat the game is over. He can ofcourse choose to abandon his body before that happens, though it might be worth fighting for!
